# Gene-Structure-Prediction 

Goal: Predict up-to-date annotation of mouse genome.  

<br />

There are two parts of the analysis: 

Part 1: Implement Baum-Welch algorithm to get the parameters of HMM model 

Part 2: Implement Gibbs sampler to sample new states in our model 

<br />

Please read Gene_Structure_Prediction.pdf for more information about the performance of our model.
